## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running
  - If you don't use Linux, share the directories `~/.ssh` and the directory of your project with Docker Desktop
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed
- [VS code remote containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed

## Setup for a project

1. Setup your configuration files
    - With style üíØ

        ```sh
        docker run -it --rm -v "/yourrepopath:/repository" iznth/devtainr:v0.2.0 -dev react -path /repository -name projectname
        ```

        Or use the [built binary](https://github.com/iznth/devtainr#binary)
    - Or manually: download this repository and put the [.devcontainer](.devcontainer) directory in your project.
1. If you have a *.vscode/settings.json*, eventually move the settings to *.devcontainer/devcontainer.json* in the `"settings"` section as *.vscode/settings.json* take precedence over the settings defined in *.devcontainer/devcontainer.json*.
1. Open the command palette in Visual Studio Code (CTRL+SHIFT+P) and select `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...` and choose your project directory
1. If you want to use the Debian based image, you can modify the .devcontainer/Dockerfile in your directory.

**Note that by default it will map the port `3000` to a random port on your host, which you can find with `docker ps`**
